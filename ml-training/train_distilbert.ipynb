    "# 🛡️ ScamShield — Fine-Tuning DistilBERT for Scam Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What is DistilBERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a large language model created by Google. It was trained on billions of sentences from Wikipedia and Books, so it already understands grammar, context, and language nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DistilBERT** is a *distilled* (compressed) version of BERT — it is:\n",
    "- **40% smaller** in size\n",
    "- **60% faster** to run\n",
    "- Retains **97% of BERT's accuracy**\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes it perfect for fine-tuning on a specific task without needing a massive cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 What is Fine-Tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "DistilBERT is pre-trained on general language. **Fine-tuning** means we continue training it on our specific dataset (scam/spam SMS messages), so it learns to distinguish between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `0` → **Safe** (normal message / ham)\n",
    "- `1` → **Scam / Spam**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like hiring a language expert and then giving them a crash course in spotting scams.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 Why Transformers for Scam Detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional ML models (like Naive Bayes or TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) look at individual words. Transformers understand **context**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"Your account is safe\"` → normal\n",
    "- `\"Your account will be blocked, click here to keep it safe\"` → scam\n",
    "\n",
    "Both sentences contain the word *safe*, but a transformer understands the urgency and call-to-action pattern that makes the second one suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 What Do the Metrics Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | What it means |\n",
    "|--------|---------------|\n",
    "| **Accuracy** | Out of all predictions, how many were correct? |\n",
    "| **Precision** | Out of all messages flagged as scam, how many actually were scams? |\n",
    "| **Recall** | Out of all actual scams, how many did we catch? |\n",
    "| **F1 Score** | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall — best single metric for imbalanced data |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** For scam detection, **Recall** is especially important. Missing a scam (False Negative) is more dangerous than a false alarm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Before You Start\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have selected a **GPU runtime**:\n",
    "> **Runtime → Change runtime type → T4 GPU → Save**"
